## Switch Board

I create this useless Switchboard to learn how to use react and to get a better understanding of components and props.

From this project I learnt
 - How react is component based.
 - How to manage component states.
 - How to lift the state of a component to a parent component.
 - How to send props to components
 - Worked on my ES6
